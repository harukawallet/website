**Introducing: Haruka Wallet**

Haruka is a multi-chain desktop wallet with a built-in decentralized exchange (DEX).
It employs Hashed Timelock Contracts (HTLC) to enable seamless cross-chain atomic swaps between XRPL and Bitcoin or Ethereum based blockchains.

Haruka is intentionally built without reliance on a single centralized backend.
Instead, it leverages a network of publicly accessible nodes to gather essential blockchain data.
It utilizes the TrustWallet Core, an open-source library that implements basic cryptographic wallet functionality for a wide range of blockchain networks.
